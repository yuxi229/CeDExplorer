# CeDExplorer

Celiac Disease Gene Expression and GWAS Analysis Toolkit

## Description

CeDExplorer is an R package designed for comprehensive analysis of celiac disease genetic and expression data. It provides tools for GWAS visualization, gene expression analysis, protein-protein interaction networks, and HLA association studies to support celiac disease research. The package addresses the need for integrated analysis of multiple data types in celiac disease research by combining GWAS summary statistics, gene expression data, and protein interaction networks into a unified workflow.

This package was developed using R version 4.3.2 on macOS platform.

## Installation

To install the latest version of the package:

```r
install.packages("devtools")
library("devtools")
devtools::install_github("yuxi-wang-98/CeDExplorer", build_vignettes = TRUE)
library("CeDExplorer")
```

To run the shinyApp: Under construction

## Overview

```r
ls("package:CeDExplorer")
data(package = "CeDExplorer")
browseVignettes("CeDExplorer")
```

### Available Functions:

- `get_celiac_gwas()`: Retrieve celiac disease GWAS summary statistics
- `plot_manhattan()`: Create Manhattan plots for GWAS visualization  
- `expression_boxplot()`: Plot gene expression across conditions
- `score_inflammation_signature()`: Calculate inflammation signature scores
- `plot_gene_network()`: Visualize protein-protein interaction networks
- `hla_interaction_plot()`: Plot HLA allele frequency vs gene expression
- `geneEvidenceView()`: Composite dashboard for gene evidence integration
